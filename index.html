    <p id="mainp">Ever since Grant Kwiecinski stepped into the electronic scene back in 2011, he completely flipped the community upside down with his effortless crossover between a multitude of genres. As a Detroit native, Kwiecinski grew up with a passion for motown and funk music. He has combined state-of-the-art audio production technology with his trusty saxophone to create his own unique image and brand -- Griz. Today, Kwiecinski has garnered a massive following and sells out nearly every show on tour. His most recent album, Ride Waves, was critically acclaimed for its fresh sound and reinvention of electro-funk.</p>
